# 🧠 Memory-Powered MCP Chat with LangChain & OpenAI

This project implements an interactive memory-enabled conversational agent using LangChain's `ChatOpenAI`, a custom `MCPAgent`, and an MCP-compatible backend client defined in `mcp_use`. The assistant supports contextual conversation memory, configurable OpenAI models, and interactive terminal-based chatting.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Conversational memory using LangChain
- 🤖 GPT-4o-mini (or any OpenAI model)
- 🗃️ Loads config from `browser_mcp.json`
- 🔁 Supports up to 15 reasoning steps
- ✨ Clear memory and exit options
- 🔐 `.env` support for managing secrets

cd mcpdemo
```

### 2. Create and Configure `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## 🧠 Customization

- **Model**: Change the model in the `ChatOpenAI` instance (default: `"gpt-4o-mini"`).
- **Memory Steps**: Modify `max_steps` in the `MCPAgent` initialization.
- **Client Config**: Update `browser_mcp.json` with your backend endpoints or connection details.

## Example 
  - You: who is the winner of IPL 2016?
  - Assistant: Thought: I need to find the winner of the IPL 2016 season.

  - **Action:** I will perform a web search to find the winner of IPL 2016.

  - **Action Input:** {"query": "IPL 2016 winner"}

  - **Observation:** The winner of IPL 2016 was the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH). They defeated the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the final.        

  - **Final Answer: The winner of IPL 2016 was Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH).**
